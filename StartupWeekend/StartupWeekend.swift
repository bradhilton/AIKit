    var description: String = "Startup Weekend is a 54 hour event, where attendees pitch ideas, form teams and start companies. These events are very community focused and provide a place for budding entrepreneurs to find co-founders, mentors and momentum for their ideas. The participants that attend have 60 seconds to make a pitch (optional), the pitches are whittled down to the top ideas, and then teams form around the ideas to come out with several developed companies or projects. Finally, the weekend culminates with demonstrations in front of an audience of judges and potential investors."
